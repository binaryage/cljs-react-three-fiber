# cljs-react-three-fiber

This is an experimental ClojureScript wrapper library for [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber).

### WORK-IN-PROGRESS

This project is a good excuse for me spend time learning some modern JS stuff and recent CLJS tools:

* shadow-cljs
* uix
* three.js
* recent React
* react-three-fiber  

#### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-react-three-fiber.git
cd cljs-react-three-fiber/examples
``` 

See [the readme](examples/readme.md) for the examples project.
