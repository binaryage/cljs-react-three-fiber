# cljs-react-three-fiber

This is an experimental ClojureScript wrapper library for [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber).

### WORK-IN-PROGRESS

This project is a good excuse for me spend time learning some modern JS stuff and recent CLJS tools:

* [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
* [uix](https://github.com/roman01la/uix)
* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* [modern react](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)
* [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber)  

#### Quick start

See the examples project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-react-three-fiber.git
cd cljs-react-three-fiber/examples
``` 

And follow in the [examples/readme](examples).
